### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media App
- **Mobile:** A photo can be uploaded to give more context about the question/what made them think of the question.
- **Story:** Allows users to share posts which consist of a "would you rather" question which gets feedback from other online users. Create connections with friends over ThoughtProvoking questions ðŸ¤¨ðŸ’­
- **Market:** Anyone who likes exploring hypothetical situations. Tailored towards a large audience. 
- **Habit:** Users can post questions whenever they want and multiple times a day. A habit can be formed whenever they think of a controversial or interesting question. 
- **Scope:** Starting scope would be creating a general feed for everyone that displays the latest posts and showing percentages and comments after they vote. If we can, we would like to implement a "popular" page that shows posts that have gained lots of attention and maybe also a feed tailored towards the user's interests (posts from friends?).
